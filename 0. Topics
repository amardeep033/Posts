-> Let me write you similar real-world stories for:
🔥 Apache Kafka (LinkedIn → stream processing empire)
🌐 Nginx (Russian engineer builds a global backbone)
🛠 Apache HTTP Server (open-source before open-source was cool)
☁️ Kubernetes (Google's baby to tame scale)
🧠 Redis (built by one man in Italy, runs half the web)
💾 PostgreSQL (an academic project turned world-class DB)



✅ OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Grafana
→ Industry-standard stack for metrics, traces, and logs (observability 3-pillar).

🧪 eBPF for Observability & Security
→ Kernel-level performance monitoring and runtime security (e.g., Cilium, Falco).

⚙️ Rust in Backend Systems
→ Used with tokio, axum, tower for high-performance async APIs.

🧠 LLMOps + Vector Databases
→ Tools like LangChain, Pinecone, and Weaviate powering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

🌐 Wasm (WebAssembly) on Backend
→ Lightweight, sandboxed runtime using tools like Fermyon & Spin for microservices.

☁️ Kubernetes + KEDA + Knative
→ Event-driven autoscaling and serverless workloads on K8s.

🔐 Zero Trust + OPA + SPIFFE
→ Fine-grained authorization and service identity in distributed systems.

🔄 Kafka + Flink + ClickHouse
→ Modern real-time data pipelines with high-throughput ingestion and querying.

🧩 Platform Engineering with Backstage
→ Developer portals and internal tooling to improve DevEx.

🧱 Modern Infra-as-Code (Crossplane, Pulumi)
→ Kubernetes-native or language-based infra automation, replacing Terraform in many cases.
